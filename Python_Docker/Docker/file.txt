# 1️⃣ First stage: Build the application
FROM python:3.11-alpine AS builder

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy requirements file separately for better caching
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install dependencies in a separate directory to avoid unnecessary files
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --target=/usr/src/app/deps -r requirements.txt

# Copy the application files
COPY . .

# Remove unnecessary files to shrink final image size
RUN rm -rf tests __pycache__

# 2️⃣ Second stage: Run the application with a Distroless image
FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian12 AS runner

# Set working directory (custom name instead of /app)
WORKDIR /python_app

# Copy only necessary files from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app /python_app
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/deps /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages

# Set a non-root user for better security
USER nonroot

# Expose application port (if needed)
EXPOSE 5000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["app.py"]
